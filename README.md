# Privacy-Preserving-Blockchain-System
Privacy-Preserving Blockchain System and Off-Chain Roll-Up for Document Handling

---

## Overview

This proposal outlines a project to implement a privacy-preserving document management system, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The project aims to create a secure and efficient platform for managing sensitive documents while ensuring data privacy and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Objectives

- Develop a privacy-preserving document management system.
- Utilize secure off-chain storage and transaction processing.
- Implement document encryption and access control mechanisms.
- Enable efficient document sharing and verification.
- Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

## Project Components

### 1. Smart Contracts

- ShareToken.sol: A Solidity smart contract for managing share tokens and voting on proposals.

- BondToken.sol: A Solidity smart contract for managing bond tokens, including issuance, redemption, and transfer.
  
- AssetToken.sol, providing an overview and structure for documenting the asset token smart contract.
  
### 2. Off-Chain Encryption

- Implement secure off-chain storage and encryption for sensitive documents.

### 3. zkSync Integration

- Integrate zkSync to enable off-chain transaction processing and reduce gas costs.

### 4. Document Management Web Portal

- Develop a user-friendly web portal for document management.

### 5. Access Control

- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict document access.

## Use Cases

- Secure storage and management of legal documents.
- Privacy-preserving supply chain document verification.
- Confidential financial document sharing.
- Secure voting mechanisms for token holders.

## How to Use

- Deploy the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Access the web portal for document management.
- Securely store and share sensitive documents.

## Compliance

- Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
- Implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and data privacy measures.
