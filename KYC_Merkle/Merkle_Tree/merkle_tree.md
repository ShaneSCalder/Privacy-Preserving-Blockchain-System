The `merkle_tree.py` file is a Python script designed to manage the creation and interaction with a Merkle Tree. Here's the breakdown of its contents and functionalities:

sha256 Function:
- This function is responsible for taking a string input, encoding it into bytes, and then computing its SHA-256 hash. The output is the hash in a hexadecimal string format.

MerkleTree Class:
- The class encapsulates all the functionalities required to create and manipulate a Merkle Tree.

Class Initialization (__init__):
- When an instance of the `MerkleTree` class is created, it is initialized with a list of hashes. These hashes represent the leaves of the Merkle Tree.
- The constructor initializes the class variables and calls the method to create the Merkle Tree.

create_tree Method:
- This method constructs the Merkle Tree using the list of hash leaves provided during the initialization. It works by iteratively combining the hashes of current-level nodes in pairs, hashing these pairs together to form the next level, and repeating this process until it gets to the root.

get_root Method:
- This method returns the root hash of the Merkle Tree, which represents the topmost node in the tree.

get_proof Method:
- For any given leaf in the Merkle Tree, this method provides a proof of inclusion. The proof is a list of the sibling hashes that would be required to reconstruct the root hash from the given leaf.

verify_proof Method:
- This method allows the verification of a proof for a given leaf hash. It checks whether the provided proof hashes, when combined in the right sequence, will reconstruct the Merkle Tree's root hash that the class instance holds.

get_user_data_hashes Function (Assumed as a placeholder in the context):
- This function would be where the actual hashes of the user's encrypted data are retrieved. For the purpose of the script, itâ€™s assumed to return a list of 50 precomputed hashes.

Merkle Tree Creation and Proof Verification:
- At the bottom of the script, the aforementioned `get_user_data_hashes` function is called to get the list of hashes. These are then used to instantiate a `MerkleTree` object.
- Using the `MerkleTree` instance, a Merkle root is retrieved, a proof of inclusion for a particular hash is generated, and then that proof is verified to show the script's full capabilities.

The file `merkle_tree.py` should be used in a secure environment where encryption and hashing of user data are done according to best practices. It is only part of a broader KYC or data integrity system and would interact with other parts of the system that handle data encryption, storage, and possibly smart contract interactions for blockchain-related operations.
